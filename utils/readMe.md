# How to label data

Run the script and input the base directory containing episode folders.

The script will open an interactive window showing main and wrist images side by side.

Navigate through steps with arrow keys, label each step by pressing:

h: to mark "Ask for Help" (label turns red).

n: to mark "No Help" (label turns green).

Press q to save the labels and close the episode window.

Labels are saved into a file named labels.json inside each episode folder.

## Important 

You should look at the next step image to determine if the current step is considered help seeking or not.
